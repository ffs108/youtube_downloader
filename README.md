Simple script that reads a csv file - converts it into a Pandas dataframe to obtain the relevant information needed to then search YouTube for it - obtain the url - then use the pytube library to obtain video in the effor to perhaps protect, or preserve these. For audio only I also included a very simple script to convert from mp4 to mp3 in case there is a need for a smaller file size in the perservation effort. The actual scrape script has become more modular than the previous iteration as well.
